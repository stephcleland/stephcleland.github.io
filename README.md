######Project 1: Portfolio######

To my knowledge, all aspects of this project have been correctly implemented.
There are more features included in my website than outlined in the assignment,
but all are to HTML and CSS standard and are fully functional. Presently, the 
website is responsive for most browser window sizes. You can access this website
through the following links:
*www.cs.tufts.edu/~sclela01
*www.stephcleland.github.io
*www.stephaniecleland.com

I have discussed this project with the following people: Tyler Lubeck & Arthur Berman

I spent a total of 10 hours creating this website.
